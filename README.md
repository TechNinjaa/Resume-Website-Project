# Resume-Website-Project
A resume website made using HTML and CSS is a platform for showcasing your skills, experience, and qualifications to potential employers and recruiters. The website should be designed to provide an easy-to-use and visually appealing platform to highlight your professional accomplishments and qualifications.

The website should start with an introduction section that includes your name, professional title, and a brief summary of your experience and skills. This section should also contain links to your social media profiles, portfolio, and contact information.

The website should also feature sections that detail your work experience, education, skills, and achievements. These sections should be structured to emphasize your most impressive accomplishments and should include detailed descriptions of your responsibilities and achievements in each role.

In addition to showcasing your experience and qualifications, your website should also be visually appealing and easy to navigate. This can be achieved through the use of a clean and minimalist design, clear typography, and appropriate use of white space. Finally, the website should be optimized for search engines, with relevant keywords included throughout the content to ensure that potential employers and recruiters can easily find you online.
